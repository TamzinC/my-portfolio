# My Portfolio


## Description

I have designed and created a portfolio through applying what I have learnt so far about HTML and CSS, and will continue to be updated as my skills develop. The webpage has also been designed to be repsonsive according to different screen sizes which will ensure the best viewing experience according to screen size. My portfolio will ultimately be used to showcase my projects that I work on.
